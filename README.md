# clj-hello-world

"Hello world" in Clojure.

## Quickstart

This is my first time working in Clojure, although not in working
with Lisps by any means, so I'm keeping this super simple. Your
options to run this are:

1. Start the `clj` interpreter, copy and paste `core.clj` verbatim,
   and then run

   ```clojure
   (hello-world.core/-main)
   ```

2. Clone this repo to a `hello_world` repo, then run

   ```bash
   clj -m hello-world.core
   ```

3. (Can I compile it?)
